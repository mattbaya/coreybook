Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a MONTAGE OF POSSIBILITIES - tiny versions of Corey scattered joyfully across the page doing ALL the careers.
**SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PAGE**: Multiple tiny versions of COREY (bald!) enthusiastically pursuing different careers:
**TOP SECTION**:
- **SPACE**: Rocketing through space in full astronaut gear
- **ROCK BAND**: Playing punk guitar (include subtle "Big Dog" sign in background!)
- **SEA CAPTAIN**: Sailing ship and singing shanties
**MIDDLE SECTION**:
- **CRAB TRAINER**: Teaching CRABS TO STAND with little crabs balancing on their legs!
- **TRUCK DRIVER**: Driving truck in reverse with complete confidence
- **LAWYER**: In courtroom dramatically pointing at corporate defendants
**BOTTOM SECTION**:
- **GOLF BALL DIVER**: Scuba diving underwater surrounded by golf balls
- **LEGO BUILDER**: Constructing a massive LEGO T-REX
**SCATTERED THROUGHOUT**:
- Testing mattresses (tiny Corey asleep with "ZZZ"s)
- Sliding down water slides with joy
- Podcasting with a cat as co-host
- Gaming with intense focus
- Styling food with tweezers
- Writing fortune cookies
- Yodeling on mountain peaks
- Training pigeons to dance
**THE ENERGY**: This should be joyful chaos of infinite possibility! Each tiny Corey should be completely enthusiastic about his chosen career path. The page should feel like it could go on forever with more and more possibilities.
**ART STYLE**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bright, varied colors for each mini-scene. Each career should have its own distinct visual style while maintaining bold outlines and flat colors. Think of it as confetti made of career dreams!
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
