Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a CLOSE-UP VIEW of Corey's hands holding an open handwritten journal/guest book.
**Main Composition:**
Show Corey's hands gently holding an open physical journal/guest book. The book should be the main focus, filling most of the frame. Show his wedding ring and the careful, respectful way he's holding this collection of personal messages.
**Journal Pages Layout:**
The open journal should show two facing pages filled with handwritten notes in various handwriting styles, different pen colors (blue, black, purple), and some pencil. Include:
**Left Page (mix of quotes):**
- "The chai and peanut butter cake was to die for!! ♥" (with small heart drawing)
- "Your pizza is the BEST!!" 
- "Best sammies in town!" (in cursive)
- "I come in here almost daily - THE best coffee!" (neat print)
- "Your gluten-free treats are the best!" (with smiley face)
**Right Page (mix of quotes):**
- "The food was fire. Bussin bussin, no fr, fr – such vibes. — Lucas" (in teen handwriting)
- "Love this café! Very warm owner! Great feel." (older handwriting)
- "My favorite café! I love the kind, welcoming vibes!!" 
- "This place puts me in a good mood." (with small sun drawing)
- "Williamstown haven! My favorite spot in town!"
**Additional Details:**
- "Carol, Portland ME: Delicious food! Beautiful place!" at bottom
- "A.J.T.: Our favorite stop... XO" with small heart
- Some partial entries visible at edges (realistic journal feel)
- Small doodles: hearts, smiley faces, stars scattered between entries
- Date stamps on some entries
**Background/Setting:**
- Soft window light creating warm glow on the pages
- Maybe edge of coffee cup or table visible
- Cozy café corner atmosphere
- Gentle shadows from the handwriting creating depth
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, emphasizing the intimate, personal nature of handwritten notes. The journal should feel lived-in and treasured, with varied handwriting styles showing the diversity of customers who loved the Store.
**Lighting**: Soft, natural lighting highlighting the journal pages, creating a warm, nostalgic feeling as Corey reads these personal messages of appreciation.
