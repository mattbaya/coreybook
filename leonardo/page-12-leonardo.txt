Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a sad montage of endings, representing the emotional low point of the story.
**Walk-in Freezer Scene**: Show the freezer door hanging open, revealing PERSONIFIED sad food. Wilting vegetables have droopy eyes, meat packages wear frowns, ice cream cartons are crying melted tears, and produce going bad looks apologetic for failing.
**Empty Dining Room**: The sunroom and main dining area are completely EMPTY. Chairs are pushed in, no customers remain. Dust motes float in pale light streaming through the sunroom windows, emphasizing the abandonment.
**Staff Departing**: Show staff members (from behind or in silhouette) walking away from the Store toward their cars, waving sad goodbyes as they head to other jobs.
**Center Image - Corey Alone**: Corey sits in one of the customer chairs (not behind his usual counter position), symbolizing his disconnection from his role. His navy blue apron is untied and hanging loose. He stares at nothing or has his bald head in his hands, showing defeat.
**Environmental Details**:
- The espresso machine is dark and cold with no steam
- The chalkboard menu is half-erased
- Include three symbolic objects representing his three years (coffee cups, calendars, or aprons)
- The Store's soul feels departed - no longer a living community hub
Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading rendered with empathy, showing genuine sadness while maintaining bold outlines and flat colors with sharp shadow edges. This is the emotional valley before the rescue arrives.
