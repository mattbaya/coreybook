Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Emily joining the family embrace with tender intimacy.
**EMILY'S APPROACH**: EMILY (short silver/gray pixie hair) steps into the group hug more gently than the kids did. Her SHORT SILVER HAIR should catch the golden light beautifully. Show her hand tenderly placed on Corey (completely bald)'s face or shoulder as she leans in close.
**THE SPEECH BUBBLE**: Include her intimate whisper: "Whatever comes next, I'll be right here. Not just when things sparkle, not just when things shine, but especially NOW—and for all of our time." This should be soft and intimate, not shouted.
**THE SETTLING**: The tackle-hug has evolved into a warm, tight FAMILY EMBRACE. The three kids are still wrapped around from all sides, their faces now peaceful and loving rather than chaotic.
**COREY'S RECOGNITION**: COREY's expression should show this is THE moment - this is what matters most. He's recognizing that family support is the foundation for everything else.
**VISUAL WARMTH**: The embrace should emit visible warmth - soft golden light radiating outward, maybe small hearts floating up. Show that they're a complete unit, an unbreakable team.
**THE TRANSITION**: This image bridges from the joyful chaos of page 1 to the deeper emotional truth - family love is the constant, whatever career path comes next.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the warmest, most golden lighting yet. The colors should be soft and intimate rather than bright and chaotic. Focus on the emotional connection and security of unconditional family love.
