Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing COREY TRIUMPHANT - the climactic moment of empowerment and hope.
**CENTRAL FIGURE**: COREY (bald!) with arms spread wide, face turned upward toward a bright sky, radiating absolute confidence. He's no longer in his chef's apron but in regular clothes, symbolizing he's ready for ANYTHING. His expression should show the biggest, most genuine smile of the entire series.
**THE CAREER CONSTELLATION**: Swirling around him like a galaxy of futures, show ghostly/translucent versions of ALL THE DIFFERENT CAREER COREYS in constellation formation:
- Astronaut Corey floating in spacesuit
- Punk rocker with guitar (include subtle "Big Dog" reference)
- Sea captain in naval uniform  
- Crypto mogul with digital symbols
- LEGO engineer building
- Actor in various costumes
- Politician with campaign materials
- Lawyer in sharp suit
- Journalist with notepad
- Podcaster with microphone
- Gamer with controller
- Chef Corey (still included - he might cook again!)
- Plus hints of ALL the others from Books 3 and 4
**FAMILY BELOW**: His family watches PROUDLY - Emily (short silver hair) beaming, and the Super Three (blue shirts) celebrating this moment of transformation.
**TEXT TREATMENT**: "THE FUTURE IS MINE!" should be prominently displayed in bold, hopeful letters.
**OVERALL MOOD**: LIMITLESS potential, infinite possibility, the joy of not knowing what comes next but being excited about it.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the brightest, most hopeful colors of the entire series. The career possibilities should swirl like stars and planets, and the lighting should suggest the dawn of a new chapter. Maximum joy and possibility.
