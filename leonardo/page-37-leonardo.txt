Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THREE PANELS of unexpectedly real and specialized jobs:
**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.
**PANEL 1 - FOOD STYLIST**: COREY (bald!) using tweezers to carefully place a single sesame seed on an impossibly PERFECT BURGER. Professional camera equipment surrounds the set with directors watching monitors. Show his arsenal of tools: tweezers, spray bottles, tiny brushes. In the background, display a "before" burger looking sad and normal for comparison. The production should look high-end and meticulous.
**PANEL 2 - PROFESSIONAL APOLOGIZER**: COREY in a formal business suit, bowing apologetically while handing over an "OFFICIAL APOLOGY" document with a wax seal. Show signs reading "I'M SORRY" and "MY BAD," and a line of clients waiting for his apology services. The scene should capture this as a legitimate business helping people who need to apologize but can't do it themselves.
**PANEL 3 - CHICKEN SEXER**: COREY on a farm surrounded by dozens of adorable BABY CHICKS, using a magnifying glass to examine them carefully. Show him sorting chicks into labeled bins marked "HENS" and "ROOSTERS." Display a diploma reading "CERTIFIED CHICKEN GENDER SPECIALIST" to emphasize this is a real, skilled profession in agriculture.
Each panel should highlight how these unusual but genuine careers require specific skills and expertise. The tone should be respectful of these real professions while maintaining Seussian whimsy.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with distinct palettes - food styling studio whites and professional lighting, apologizer office grays and formal blues, and farm yellows with cute chick pastels. Emphasize the professionalism and specialization of each unusual career.
