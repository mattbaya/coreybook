Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THE TRIUMPHANT EXIT - a family walking boldly toward their future.
**WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT**: The family of FIVE walks AWAY from the Store together, toward the viewer and their future, holding hands in a confident line. They should be LAUGHING and relaxed, completely FREE from the weight of the past.
**THE FAMILY**:
- **COREY** (bald!) walking tall and confident, no longer worried
- **EMILY** (short silver hair) with her hair catching the sunset light
- **THE SUPER THREE** (blue Super3 shirts) excited for the adventure ahead
**BEHIND THEM**: The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) sits peacefully with its cream siding and green shutters. It should look like a fond memory, not a prison - a chapter CLOSED, not a failure.
**IN FRONT**: FIVE ROADS stretch out, each a DIFFERENT VIBRANT COLOR - red, orange, yellow, green, blue - creating rainbow paths to different futures. This represents five family members, five roads, five possibilities.
**THE SKY**: Create the most SPECTACULAR sunset of the entire series - brilliant oranges, pinks, and purples stretching across the sky. The Berkshire mountains should frame the horizon majestically.
**THE FEELING**: Freedom, possibility, family unity, and the confidence that comes from knowing you're not facing the future alone.
**THE SYMBOLISM**: They're walking from their past toward unlimited possibilities, together as a family, with five colorful roads representing infinite potential paths.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the most vibrant sunset colors of the series. The rainbow roads should be bold and inviting, and the family should be silhouetted against the magnificent sky, walking confidently into their bright future.
