Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing the EMOTIONAL CLIMAX - the most heartwarming moment of the entire series.
**THE FAMILY EMBRACE**: All five family members in the warmest, tightest family embrace possible:
**COREY** (bald!) in the center with tears of JOY on his cheeks - this should be the happiest we've seen him across all five books. He's feeling the full weight of unconditional love.
**EMILY** pressed close with her SHORT SILVER HAIR against his shoulder, eyes closed in pure contentment and peace.
**THE THREE KIDS** wrapped around from all sides, faces peaceful and loving:
- **Remi with dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt) showing protective strength
- **OONA** (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt) radiating joy and brightness  
- **ZEPHYR** (light brown messy hair, blue Super3 shirt) feeling completely safe and adored
**THE VISUAL LOVE**: The embrace should emit visible warmth - soft golden light radiating outward and little hearts floating up. This represents the unbreakable power of family love.
**THE CORE TRUTH**: This illustration should capture that love wins, family wins, hope wins. They're a unit, a team, unbreakable when they're together.
**THE MESSAGE**: Whatever happens next, Corey has something no setback can destroy - a family who loves him not for his success, but for who he is, especially during the hard times.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the WARMEST, MOST GOLDEN lighting of the entire series. This should be the emotional peak - tissues-required beautiful. Maximum heart and love, representing the foundation that makes everything else possible.
