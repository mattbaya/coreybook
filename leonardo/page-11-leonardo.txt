Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing an interior shot of The Store at Five Corners looking abandoned and sad.
The main scene shows the interior mostly dark, unused, with cobwebs in corners. Food is visibly rotting in the background - moldy items in display cases, spoiled produce, and abandoned meals.
Corey (completely BALD) stands alone in the dark interior holding two signs:
- One sign reads: "Sorry Folks, Store's Closed!"
- Another sign reads: "Temporarily Closed due to really gross water supply issues"
The atmosphere should be melancholy and defeated - dusty surfaces, dim lighting filtering through dirty windows, equipment covered in dust sheets or just sitting unused. Show the once-lively store now empty and deteriorating.
Corey looks exhausted and sad but resigned, his navy blue apron still on but disheveled. His posture shows defeat but also a kind of weary acceptance of the situation.
Only Corey appears in this image - no other people, emphasizing his isolation and the emptiness of the failed dream.
Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading emphasizing exhaustion and repeated failure, featuring bold outlines and flat colors. The mood should show Corey's diminishing hope as disaster strikes twice.
