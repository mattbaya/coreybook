## PHIL FOGLIO-INSPIRED ELEMENTS

### Expressive Faces & Emotions
- **Characters emote BIG** - wide grins, shocked eyes, dramatic reactions
- **Large, prominent eyes** with detailed irises and highly expressive eyebrows
- **Strong, distinctive nose shapes** that vary by character (helps differentiation)
- **Exaggerated mouth expressions** - big smiles showing teeth, dramatic frowns, lots of open-mouth reactions
- **Varied chin and jaw shapes** to distinguish characters (square jaws, pointed chins, rounded faces)

### Dynamic Energy & Poses
- **High-energy, dynamic poses** - bodies in motion, not static
- **Expressive hands** - always gesturing, pointing, reaching, reacting
- **Weight and movement** in figures - characters feel grounded but lively
- **Comedy-friendly staging** - poses that support humor and drama equally
- **Action lines and motion indicators** when characters are moving

### Confident Linework
- **Clean, bold ink lines** with professional confidence
- **Varying line weights** - thicker outlines for main elements, thinner for details
- **Crosshatching sparingly** for shadows and texture in detailed areas
- **Lines that flow and curve** - avoiding stiffness

### Detailed Backgrounds
- **Rich environmental detail** - machinery, architecture, objects all rendered with care
- **Props and settings that tell stories** - cluttered shelves, professional equipment, meaningful details
- **Background doesn't compete with characters** but adds depth and interest

## CEL-SHADING TECHNIQUE

### Bold Outlines
- **All elements** defined by clean, prominent, dark outlines
- **Characters, clothing, and background objects** all use consistent outline weight
- **Sharp, defined edges** that separate elements clearly
- **Outlines help maintain visual clarity** in busy scenes

### Flat Colors with Cel-Shading
- **Solid, flat blocks of color** as the foundation
- **No gradients** - depth created through cel-shading technique
- **Darker shades of same color** applied to specific shadow areas:
  - Under chins and facial features
  - Inside clothing folds and creases
  - Beneath overhanging elements
  - Interior corners and recessed areas
- **Sharp, clean shadow edges** without soft transitions
- **Consistent lighting direction** throughout each illustration

### Color Palette Strategy
- **Bold, saturated colors** that pop off the page
- **Emotional color coding**:
  - Warm golds/oranges for happy, hopeful scenes
  - Cool blues/grays for sad, stressed moments
  - Vibrant rainbow colors for fantasy sequences
  - Rich, deep colors for dramatic moments
