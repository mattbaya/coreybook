Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing DRAMATIC CONTRAST from the previous page's sadness. This is the rescue moment!
Show Corey turning around, his expression shifting from sadness to SURPRISE and dawning joy. The bundled apron he was holding falls from his surprised hands as he sees his family approaching.
Running UP the road toward the Store (weaving through the construction cones from Book 1), show his FAMILY - four figures in motion with arms waving, clearly shouting to him:
**EMILY** leads the charge with her distinctive SHORT SILVER/GRAY PIXIE-CUT HAIR, running and waving. She should have a radiant smile and confident energy.
**THE SUPER THREE** run behind her, all wearing their BLUE T-SHIRTS with the SUPER3 LOGO (red red diamond shield with yellow '3' with yellow "3" in center):
- **REMI**: Dark brown straight hair, fists pumped, energetic and brave
- **OONA**: Long honey blonde hair bouncing as she JUMPS while running  
- **ZEPHYR**: Smallest but with mouth WIDEST OPEN, clearly the loudest, maximum energy
The COLOR PALETTE should SHIFT dramatically - warm golden light breaks through the gray melancholy of the previous scene. Yellow and orange tones flood in, representing hope arriving.
Motion lines and energy should burst from the approaching family. Corey's posture changes mid-page from slumped to straightening up as hope returns.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading emphasizing the dramatic emotional shift from despair to hope through the power of family love, featuring bold outlines and flat colors.
