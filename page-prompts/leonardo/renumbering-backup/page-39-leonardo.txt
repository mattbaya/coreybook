Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a CHAOTIC PAGE of absurd career possibilities:
**TOP LEFT - YODELING**: COREY (bald!) on a Swiss Alpine peak wearing lederhosen, mouth WIDE open yodeling "YODEL-AY-HEE-HOO!" The sound should echo off the mountain peaks. A St. Bernard dog watches with interest.
**TOP RIGHT - PIGEON DANCE INSTRUCTOR**: COREY in a tuxedo conducting PIGEONS wearing tiny top hats as they perform a ballroom waltz. Include a sign reading "COREY-O-GRAPHY PIGEON DANCE STUDIO." On the wall, show a poster of Bert from Sesame Street with a plaque below it reading "OUR FOUNDER" as tribute to the famous pigeon-loving character.
**MIDDLE - SALT SHOP OWNER**: COREY surrounded by shelves absolutely PACKED with different salts - Himalayan, black lava, smoked, truffle, etc. Show amazed customers discovering salt varieties. Store sign: "COREY'S 1,000 SALTS."
**BOTTOM - MAD INVENTOR**: COREY in lab coat and goggles with wild inventions:
- "SINGING WAFFLE MACHINE" with waffles that have mouths singing "La la!"
- "JOKE HAT" with speech bubble: "Why did the chicken..."
- ROLLER SKATES that are TEN FEET LONG, stretching off the page
THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) should be visible enthusiastically suggesting the inventor career, pointing excitedly at the creative possibilities.
The page should feel wonderfully chaotic with careers getting increasingly absurd and inventive. Each section should have its own distinct style while maintaining the overall Seussian energy.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with a riot of colors - Alpine blues and whites, elegant ballroom purples, earthy salt browns, and mad scientist laboratory greens and bubbling effects. The overall feeling should be joyful creative chaos.
