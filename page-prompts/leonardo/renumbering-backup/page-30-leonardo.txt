CHARACTER CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL):

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's lawyer fantasy in a dramatic courtroom setting.
The main focus is LAWYER COREY (bald!) in a sharp suit, pointing dramatically at the defendant's table where EVIL CORPORATE EXECUTIVES cower. These villains should look cartoonish with money bag heads and suits made of dollar bills, representing mega-corporation greed.
Behind Corey: a line of GRATEFUL CLIENTS - chefs in aprons and small business owners looking relieved and thankful for his legal representation.
Key courtroom elements:
- Judge's nameplate reading "JUSTICE"
- Legal books on Corey's table: "FIGHTING THE POWER" and "LEASES FOR DUMMIES"
- A prominent business card: "COREY WENTWORTH, ESQ." in fancy script lettering
- A scoreboard showing "LITTLE GUYS: 47 / MEGA CORPS: 0"
The best detail: OONA (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) wearing a tiny judge's wig and robes, seriously banging an oversized gavel from the judge's bench, fully committed to her role in this fantasy.
The scene should capture the David vs. Goliath energy of a small-town lawyer taking on corporate power and winning. Corey looks confident and principled, fighting for justice with the backing of the community.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with dramatic courtroom lighting, bold contrast between the good guys (warm colors) and corporate villains (cold money-greens), and exaggerated expressions emphasizing the moral victory theme.
