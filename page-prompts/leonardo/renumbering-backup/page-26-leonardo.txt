Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's acting fantasy in FOUR PANELS:
**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.
**PANEL 1 - "THE BEAR"**: COREY (bald!) in intense kitchen scene wearing chef whites, shouting "YES CHEF!" with dramatic concentration. Include a clapperboard showing "THE BEAR" and the high-stress restaurant atmosphere.
**PANEL 2 - IRON CHEF**: COREY in the Iron Chef stadium with dramatic lighting and flames shooting from his cooking station. He's holding a weird ingredient (MARSHMALLOWS) and looking determined in the competition setting.
**PANEL 3 - VAMPIRE**: COREY in an awkward vampire costume with cape and fangs, fake blood on his chin, but looking more goofy than scary. A frustrated director off to the side is shouting "MORE SCARY!" while Corey tries harder to look menacing but fails adorably.
**PANEL 4 - DANNY KAYE**: COREY in old Hollywood musical style, tap dancing with a top hat, surrounded by stars and spotlights in classic theatrical fashion. He should look joyful and theatrical.
In the background of all panels, show THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) holding "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION" signs and cheering their dad on.
Each panel should capture a different acting genre while maintaining Corey's warm personality. The vampire scene should be particularly funny since he's clearly not cut out to be scary.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with exaggerated expressions, bold panel borders, and bright stage lighting effects. Each panel should have its own color palette - kitchen whites/reds, stadium blues/oranges, gothic purples/blacks, and theatrical golds/reds.
