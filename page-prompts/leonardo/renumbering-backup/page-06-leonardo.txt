Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a CLOSE-UP VIEW of an iPad displaying multiple glowing reviews.
**Main Composition:**
Show only Corey's hands holding a large iPad horizontally. His hands should show he's a working chef - maybe slight flour dusting, clean but worked hands, wedding ring on left hand. The iPad fills most of the frame.
**iPad Screen Layout:**
The screen should show a review aggregator or multiple review site tabs. In the DEAD CENTER of the screen, in the LARGEST FONT:
**"Finally someone who KNOWS what they're doing!"**
(This should be the dominant text element, perhaps with a golden glow or highlight box around it)
**Surrounding Reviews (various sizes, creating depth):**
Arranged around the central quote like a constellation:
Upper area:
- "Chef Corey is awesome!" ★★★★★
- "Captain of this amazingly run ship" ★★★★★
- "Best croissant I've had in my life" ★★★★★
Left side:
- "For the first time in my almost 40 years..." ★★★★★
- "The place is packed!" 
- "One of THE BEST breakfast sandwiches" ★★★★★
Right side:
- "Crispy chicken is a must have!" ★★★★★
- "Food obsessed in the best way" ★★★★★
- "Ridiculously good!" ★★★★★
Lower area:
- "Great baked goods!" ★★★★★
- "Service with a smile" ★★★★★
- "Worth the stop!" ★★★★★
- "What a find!" ★★★★★
**Visual Details:**
- Include small review site logos (Yelp, Google, etc.)
- Show "215 reviews • 4.4 stars" type headers
- Add floating heart reactions, thumbs up icons
- Some reviews partially visible at edges (scrollable feel)
- Soft glow from screen illuminating Corey's hands
- Maybe notification badges showing "New Review!" 
**Background:**
Slightly blurred kitchen counter edge, maybe a coffee cup partially visible, creating intimate close-up feel.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, focusing on the glowing screen as the light source, creating dramatic lighting on Corey's hands. The central review should be impossible to miss - the clear hero quote of the scene.
