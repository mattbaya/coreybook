Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a dramatic, alarming scene in The Store kitchen. This is the first major disaster to strike.
The scene shows Corey standing at the kitchen sink, turning on the tap. The water that comes out is BRIGHT SICKLY GREEN and menacing! Include little cartoon bacteria with worried faces floating in the water, or skull-and-crossbones bubbles to show contamination.
Corey's eyes are WIDE with shock, his mouth open in dismay as he stares at the toxic-looking water. His bald head reflects his horror at this turn of events.
A HEALTH INSPECTOR bursts through the kitchen door, clipboard in hand, pointing dramatically and shouting "E. COLI!" A bright red "BOIL WATER ORDER" notice is being slapped on the wall or window.
Show a calendar on the wall displaying "OCTOBER" with Columbus Day weekend circled, indicating the timing of this disaster.
The professional espresso machine and other kitchen taps should look "BETRAYED" - all dripping the same sickly green water. The color palette should shift to alarming colors: sickly greens, warning yellows, and alarm reds.
This represents Corey's sanctuary (the kitchen) being invaded by forces beyond his control.
Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with dramatic, alarming colors featuring bold outlines and flat colors. The contaminated water should look obviously bad but in a cartoonish rather than realistic way with sharp shadow edges.
