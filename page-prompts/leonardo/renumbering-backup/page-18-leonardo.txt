Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Zephyr's astronaut fantasy sequence.
The main focus is ASTRONAUT COREY (still completely bald!) floating inside a retro-futuristic rocket ship in zero gravity. He wears a classic astronaut spacesuit with a clear bubble helmet and is actively FLIPPING PANCAKES that float in zero-gravity bubbles around him! Each pancake should have a happy smiling face.
The rocket ship interior should be whimsical with:
- Colorful control panels with impossible buttons and dials
- Floating kitchen equipment (spatulas, syrup bottles, coffee cups)
- A bright neon sign visible through the window: "SPACE CAFÉ - NOW OPEN ON MARS!"
Through the rocket's windows, show the fantastical view of space:
- Colorful Seussian planets with exaggerated, impossible features
- Saturn with CURLY, twisted rings (not straight rings)
- A smiling moon that might be waving
- Twinkling stars with personality - some winking at the viewer
- The surface of Mars below with red Seussian landscape features
In one corner of the page, show small ZEPHYR (light brown messy hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) pointing excitedly at her suggested fantasy, clearly proud of this creative idea.
The overall feeling should be pure joy and whimsy - the magic of a child's imagination turning space travel into the ultimate cooking adventure.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bold outlines, clean prominent dark lines, and a color palette dominated by space blues, cosmic purples, and the warm yellows/oranges of the space café elements.
