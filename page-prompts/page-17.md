## PAGE TEXT
And Emily laughed and she pulled out a list—
A list that was long, that went TWIST after TWIST!
"We brainstormed," she grinned, "all the things you could BE!
So sit down and listen—from US, your family!"

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Emily dramatically revealing the family's brainstorm session.

Emily (short silver hair, mischievous confident smile) dramatically produces and UNROLLS an ABSURDLY LONG LIST/SCROLL. The list should be SO long it twists and curls around the entire scene - around Corey (completely bald), around the kids, out toward the viewer, maybe even wrapping around a construction cone for comedic effect.

The visible portions of the list show tantalizing glimpses of different careers written in a mix of Emily's neat handwriting and the kids' crayon scrawl:
- "ASTRONAUT!" (neat writing)
- "ROCK STAR!" (with musical notes drawn around it)
- "CAPTAIN!" (with small boat doodle)
- "INVENTOR!" (in crayon)
- "PENGUIN TRAINER?" (with question mark and penguin drawing)

The Super Three (all in blue Super3 t-shirts (logo reference: images/super3v3.png)) gather excitedly around different parts of the list, pointing at their favorite suggestions:
- **REMI**: Dark brown straight hair, pointing decisively at one section
- **Oona**: Long honey hair bouncing as she examines another part
- **Zephyr**: Smallest, pointing enthusiastically at her contributions

Corey sits down (maybe on a construction barrier or the Store's porch steps), leaning forward with genuine INTEREST and a growing smile. This sets up the fantasy sequences to come - the family brainstorm session begins!





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the absurdly long list as a major visual element, emphasizing family collaboration and growing excitement about possibilities, featuring bold outlines and flat colors.
