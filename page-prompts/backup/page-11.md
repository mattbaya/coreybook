He closed for a day. Then he opened once more.
But in NOVEMBER it happened AGAIN at the Store!
The food in the freezer went bad, one by one.
The customers stopped coming. The cooking was done.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing the CYCLE of hope and disappointment. At the top, show three small panels with door signs cycling: "CLOSED" → "OPEN AGAIN!" → "CLOSED AGAIN"

The main scene shows NOVEMBER - bare trees visible through windows, gray sky, perhaps early frost or snow on the Berkshire mountains in the background, emphasizing the cold, bleak timing.

The green contaminated water has RETURNED, worse than before. Now it's coming from MULTIPLE taps and faucets like a coordinated attack - all bright toxic green. The health officials are back with their clipboards, shaking their heads grimly.

Corey looks EXHAUSTED and defeated, slumped against the counter in his dark olive-green apron, his bald head hanging in despair. This is his second major blow.

Show a calendar displaying "NOVEMBER" with multiple days X-ed out, indicating extended closure. Include:
- A pot of water boiling on the stove with a sad face forming in the steam
- The beautiful espresso machine sitting silent with a "DO NOT USE" sign taped to it
- Food in the display case wilting and looking apologetic
- The overall feeling that his dream is dying

Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading emphasizing exhaustion and repeated failure, featuring bold outlines and flat colors. The mood should show Corey's diminishing hope as disaster strikes twice.
