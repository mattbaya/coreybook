Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's political fantasy sequence.

The main focus is POLITICIAN COREY (completely bald!) at a campaign rally podium with "COREY 2028" banners, American flags, and confetti falling. He wears an ill-fitting suit (clearly more comfortable in an apron than formal wear) but looks enthusiastic.

Key political elements to include:
- Campaign buttons scattered around reading "COREY FOR SOMETHING!" and "FREE SCONES FOR ALL!"
- A campaign bus in the background with his face prominently displayed
- Signs reading "CHEFS FOR CHANGE!" and "YES WE CAN (COOK)!"
- A platform/podium sign listing his agenda: "1. Better Soup 2. More Nachos 3. Free Coffee"

The classic political moment: COREY KISSING A BABY. The baby should look confused but happy about this political ritual.

THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) should be visible in the crowd, enthusiastically waving tiny American flags and cheering for "Candidate Dad."

The overall atmosphere should capture political campaign energy but with Corey's food-focused, wholesome approach to politics. Everything should feel slightly absurd but heartwarming - like a chef who accidentally ended up in politics but is trying his best.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bold red, white, and blue patriotic colors, clean campaign banners, and exaggerated political rally atmosphere. Confetti and flags should have dynamic movement and energy with bold outlines.
