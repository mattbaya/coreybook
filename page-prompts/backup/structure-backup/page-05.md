## PAGE TEXT
Corey checked his phone with growing delight—
The reviews were coming in day and night!
"Chef Corey is awesome!"* and "Food's divine!"
"Five stars!" they declared. "This place really does shine!"

And then the review sites that once sat silent awoke,
"5 stars! Thumbs Up! 'Ridiculously Good!"* they wrote.
"Finally someone who knows what they're doing!"* penned others,
And they told all their sisters and brothers.

"Beautifully composed sandwiches!"* typed a fan,
"Food obsessed in the best way!"* wrote another woman or man.
"Service with a smile!"* and "What a find!"*
The compliments poured in of every kind.

From Yelp to Google, from here to there,
The praise for Corey floated everywhere!
His phone buzzed and pinged with each new review,
And cars overflowed his tiny parking lot too!

"Great baked goods!"* "Crispy chicken sandwich!"* "Worth the stop!"*
The five-star ratings just wouldn't stop!
And Corey stood beaming in his kitchen so bright,
Reading reviews by phone's holographic light.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey in his kitchen during the peak success period, holding up his smartphone with pure joy and pride.

**Corey's Position & Expression:**
Show Corey (completely bald, navy blue apron, huge warm smile) standing confidently in his kitchen, holding his phone at eye level with both hands. His expression should show genuine delight and pride as he reads the reviews. His eyes should be sparkling with happiness, and his posture should be confident and proud.

**3D Holographic Phone Effects:**
The phone screen should emit a large, glowing 3D holographic **THUMBS UP** that appears to float above and out of the screen. Surrounding this should be floating **FIVE GOLD STARS** with sparkle effects.

**Floating Review Quotes:**
Include speech bubbles or floating text snippets with actual quotes from the reviews:

Main/larger quotes:
- "Chef Corey is awesome!" 
- "Finally someone who knows what they're doing!"
- "Ridiculously good!"
- "Worth the stop!"

Additional floating quotes (smaller):
- "Beautifully composed sandwiches!"
- "Food obsessed in the best way!"
- "Service with a smile!"
- "What a find!"
- "Best croissant I've had in my life"
- "Great baked goods!"
- "Crispy chicken is a must have!"
- "One of THE BEST freshly made breakfast sandwiches"

- "The place is packed!"
- "5 stars!"

Include some partial reviews floating in background:
- "Captain of this amazingly run ship..."
- "Best latte I've had anywhere..."
- "So happy to have The Store back..."

**Kitchen Setting:**
Show the warm, professional kitchen during its peak - clean counters, the professional espresso machine in background, warm golden light streaming through windows. Everything should look successful and thriving.

**Color Palette & Effects:**
Use warm, glowing colors - golden yellows, bright blues for the phone screen, sparkly effects around the holographic elements. The 3D thumbs up should be bright green or blue with a glossy, dimensional appearance. Stars should be golden and twinkling.

Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, and special attention to the glowing, dimensional effects of the phone's holographic display. The scene should radiate success, validation, and joy - this is Corey at his peak, feeling appreciated for his hard work.
