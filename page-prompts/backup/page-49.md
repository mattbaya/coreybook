Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a loving farewell to the Store - honoring the past while embracing the future.

**MAIN FOCUS**: Looking BACK at the Store from the family's perspective as they pause in their journey forward. The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) should glow warmly in the sunset - the cream siding appearing golden in the light, green shutters peaceful, the "Est. 1787" sign visible and honored.

**THE STORE'S DIGNITY**: The building should look peaceful and at rest, not abandoned or sad. It has dignity and beauty, ready for ITS next story too. This isn't about failure - it's about a chapter ending gracefully.

**HAPPY MEMORIES**: Create a gentle ghostly montage floating above the Store - translucent scenes of the good times:
- Corey cooking with joy
- Customers laughing and gathering
- Coffee steam rising from warm mugs
- Community moments and connection
- The life and love that happened here

**FAMILY SILHOUETTES**: In the foreground, show the family's silhouettes - clearly recognizable (Corey's bald head, Emily's short hair, three kids in graduated heights) looking back fondly before continuing their journey forward.

**THE FEELING**: This should have a gentle "THANK YOU" energy. The Store gave them three years of memories worth more than gold. It wasn't a failure or loss - it was simply a chapter, and now it's time to turn the page.

**THE WISDOM**: Include the message that this building has stood for over 200 years, has seen many chapters, and will see more. Each ending is just a new beginning.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with warm, forgiving sunset colors - golds, soft oranges, peaceful purples. The memories should be rendered in soft, translucent style, and the overall mood should be gratitude and peace, not sadness.
