"Papa," said Zephyr (the littlest one),
"You can do ANYTHING now that you're done!
You could fly to the MOON! You could dance! You could sing!
You're our dad—and our dad can do ANYTHING!"

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading focusing on a tender close-up moment between Corey and his youngest daughter.

Show ZEPHYR (smallest, light brown messy hair, blue Super3 shirt (logo reference: images/super3v3.png)) holding her father's much larger hand in BOTH of her small hands. She looks UP at Corey (completely bald) with enormous, shining, hopeful eyes and the biggest smile a child can make. Her expression shows pure love and absolute faith in her father.

Corey looks down at his daughter, and his expression should show the sadness melting away like snow in spring. Happy tears might be forming, but they're joyful tears now. This is the emotional hinge of the entire transformation - the moment when despair turns to hope through a child's love.

A THOUGHT BUBBLE or IMAGINATION CLOUD blooms above them, showing tiny preview vignettes of Corey in various careers: floating toward the moon in a spacesuit, dancing on a stage with spotlights, singing into a microphone - previewing the possibilities to come in later books.

The other family members (Emily with her short silver hair, Remi and Oona in their Super3 shirts) watch from nearby, smiling warmly at this tender moment.

The Store should be visible in the soft background, but it's no longer the focus. Family connection is everything now.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading emphasizing the tender relationship between father and daughter, with warm golden light and the promise of infinite possibility, featuring bold outlines and flat colors.
