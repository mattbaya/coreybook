Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Oona's sea captain fantasy sequence.

The main focus is CAPTAIN COREY (still completely bald!) at the helm of a magnificent sailing ship. He wears a classic navy captain's uniform with brass buttons, a captain's hat adorned with Seussian gold braid, and has a brass telescope at his belt. His coat should be flowing dramatically in the sea breeze.

Corey is actively SINGING with his mouth wide open, one hand confidently on the ship's wheel. Musical staff and notes should flow from his mouth, with visible lyrics: "What shall we DO with a DRUNKEN SAILOR?" and "Early in the morning!"

The ship should be grand and detailed with:
- Full billowing sails catching the wind
- Proper rigging and maritime details
- A diverse crew of sailors singing along enthusiastically
- Crew members holding mugs of grog (clearly root beer for family-friendliness!)
- Everyone joining in the maritime song with visible musical enjoyment

The ocean setting includes:
- Sparkling blue waters with Seussian wave patterns
- Happy dolphins leaping alongside the ship
- A distant tropical island with palm trees on the horizon
- Perfect sailing weather with seabirds following

Show OONA (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) in the corner making a captain pose herself, shouting with cheer about this nautical adventure idea.

The scene should capture the romance and adventure of the high seas, with the traditional "Drunken Sailor" sea shanty creating a musical, joyful atmosphere.
