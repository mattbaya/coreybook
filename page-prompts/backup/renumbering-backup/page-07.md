## PAGE TEXT
And hikers and bikers and locals came too,
There's Duncan, Ronan, Sherwood, and Matt,
And Bette and Barbara, Cecilia and Paul.
Why even Mary Pope Osborne stopped in for a snack!

And many wrote notes in the journal there too,
All singing his praise after tasting his soups:
"Your pizza is BEST!" and "Sammies divine!"
"This chai and cake made my whole day shine!"

"The food was fire! Bussin bussin, no cap!"*
Young Lucas had written, then came back to nap.
"My favorite café!" and "Such welcoming vibes!"
"This place lifts my mood!" all the visitors scribe.

From Portland came Carol: "Delicious! So neat!"
"A must-stop each autumn!" for their annual treat.
The journal pages filled up, line after line,
With praise for his cooking and space so divine.

The open journal should show two facing pages filled with handwritten notes in various handwriting styles, different pen colors (blue, black, purple), and some pencil. Include:
