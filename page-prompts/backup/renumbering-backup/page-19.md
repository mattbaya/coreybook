Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Remi's punk rock fantasy sequence.

The main focus is PUNK ROCK COREY center stage, still completely bald but wearing a dramatic spiked MOHAWK WIG. He's dressed in a BLACK LEATHER JACKET covered with silver studs and spikes, SHREDDING an electric guitar that literally shoots LIGHTNING BOLTS and FLAMES!

The massive concert stage should feature:
- Dramatic NEON LIGHTS in pink, blue, and green shooting in all directions
- A wild crowd in silhouette going absolutely crazy
- THE SUPER THREE as his backup band, wearing tiny leather jackets OVER their blue Super3 t-shirts:
  - Remi on drums with sticks flying
  - Oona on bass, honey hair whipping as she rocks out  
  - Zephyr at keyboards, tiny but playing with maximum energy

**IMPORTANT VISUAL EASTER EGG** - Include "Big Dog" branding throughout but NEVER mention it in the text:
- "Big Dog" in GIANT FLAMING LETTERS above the stage
- "Big Dog" logo prominently on the drum kit
- "Big Dog" concert posters visible in the background
- Crowd members waving "Big Dog" merchandise

Sound effects should be visible - musical notes, lightning, flames, and "ROCK!" sound effects bursting from the scene.

Show enthusiastic REMI (dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt) in the corner, shouting with glee and air guitaring along with his suggested fantasy.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading but with rock concert energy - bold outlines, clean prominent dark lines, and electric colors (hot pinks, electric blues, flame oranges) to capture the high-energy punk rock atmosphere.
