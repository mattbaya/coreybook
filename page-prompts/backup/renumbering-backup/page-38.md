Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THREE PANELS of creative career opportunities:

**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.

**PANEL 1 - STOCK PHOTO MODEL**: COREY (bald!) appears in multiple poses on FLOATING POWERPOINT SLIDES around him - pointing at graphs looking impressed, shaking hands, giving thumbs up, and laughing at salad (classic stock photo poses). Each slide should have watermarks. In the background, show a corporate meeting where people are actually using presentations featuring his images. He should be EVERYWHERE, representing the ubiquity of stock photos.

**PANEL 2 - FORTUNE COOKIE WRITER**: COREY at a tiny desk surrounded by MOUNTAINS of fortune paper slips. Show his latest creation: "A SPATULA IN TIME SAVES NINE." Include weird ones scattered around: "BEWARE THE TUESDAY PENGUIN" and "YOUR LUCKY NUMBER IS CHEESE." A fortune cookie factory should be visible churning in the background, mass-producing his wisdom.

**PANEL 3 - MINI GOLF DESIGNER**: COREY standing proudly in an ELABORATE mini golf course with ABSURD obstacles: windmill, loop-de-loop, erupting volcano, whale mouth, castle with moat. Show frustrated golfers attempting impossible shots. Include signage reading "COREY'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MINI GOLF" and his designer business card.

Each panel should capture a different type of creative work - visual modeling, written wisdom, and experiential design. The progression should show increasingly complex creative challenges.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bright, varied color palettes - corporate blues and whites for stock photos, warm wisdom yellows for fortune cookies, and playful mini golf carnival colors. Each panel should emphasize the creative and slightly absurd nature of these real but unusual careers.
