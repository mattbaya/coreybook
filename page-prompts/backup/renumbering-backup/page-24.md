Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's AI programmer fantasy sequence.

The main focus is TECH DEVELOPER COREY (completely bald!) in a modern hoodie, sitting at a futuristic workstation with a glowing keyboard. He's surrounded by floating holographic code and AI robot assistants that look friendly and whimsical (not threatening).

The screens around him show:
- "PI or PIE?" app displaying both a mathematical pi symbol AND a delicious-looking pie
- "COREY'S USED SPATULAS - Only $3.00!" website
- A video game that looks like Minecraft but with ROUNDER blocks and DUCKS swimming around

AI robots float nearby with speech bubbles. One should be saying "HAVE YOU TRIED TURNING IT OFF AND ON?" in a helpful but slightly confused way.

In the background corner, show ZEPHYR (light brown messy hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) playing the duck game on a tablet, giving an enthusiastic thumbs up.

The workspace should feel high-tech but whimsical, with floating code, multiple glowing screens, and that classic Seussian sense of organized chaos. The mood is excited innovation - Corey discovering the joy of creating with technology.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bold outlines, clean prominent dark lines, and bold colors dominated by tech blues and glowing screen yellows/greens.
