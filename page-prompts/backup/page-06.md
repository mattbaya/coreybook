## PAGE TEXT
The tablet glowed bright with review after review,
Each one more delightful than the last one he knew!
In the center, one comment made Corey's heart sing:
"Finally someone who KNOWS what they're doing!"

Around it, more praises came flooding the screen,
The nicest reviews that he'd ever seen!
From "Captain of this ship" to "Best croissant in life"—
He couldn't wait to share this with Emily, his wife!

"The place is now PACKED!" wrote a forty-year neighbor,
"Worth every penny!" praised those who would savor
His crispy fried chicken, his sandwiches divine,
His coffee, his soups—everything was just fine!

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a CLOSE-UP VIEW of an iPad displaying multiple glowing reviews.

**Main Composition:**
Show only Corey's hands holding a large iPad horizontally. His hands should show he's a working chef - maybe slight flour dusting, clean but worked hands, wedding ring on left hand. The iPad fills most of the frame.

**iPad Screen Layout:**
The screen should show a review aggregator or multiple review site tabs. In the DEAD CENTER of the screen, in the LARGEST FONT:

**"Finally someone who KNOWS what they're doing!"**
(This should be the dominant text element, perhaps with a golden glow or highlight box around it)

**Surrounding Reviews (various sizes, creating depth):**
Arranged around the central quote like a constellation:

Upper area:
- "Chef Corey is awesome!" ★★★★★
- "Captain of this amazingly run ship" ★★★★★
- "Best croissant I've had in my life" ★★★★★

Left side:
- "For the first time in my almost 40 years..." ★★★★★
- "The place is packed!" 
- "One of THE BEST breakfast sandwiches" ★★★★★

Right side:
- "Crispy chicken is a must have!" ★★★★★
- "Food obsessed in the best way" ★★★★★
- "Ridiculously good!" ★★★★★

Lower area:
- "Great baked goods!" ★★★★★
- "Service with a smile" ★★★★★
- "Worth the stop!" ★★★★★
- "What a find!" ★★★★★

**Visual Details:**
- Include small review site logos (Yelp, Google, etc.)
- Show "215 reviews • 4.4 stars" type headers
- Add floating heart reactions, thumbs up icons
- Some reviews partially visible at edges (scrollable feel)
- Soft glow from screen illuminating Corey's hands
- Maybe notification badges showing "New Review!" 

**Background:**
Slightly blurred kitchen counter edge, maybe a coffee cup partially visible, creating intimate close-up feel.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, focusing on the glowing screen as the light source, creating dramatic lighting on Corey's hands. The central review should be impossible to miss - the clear hero quote of the scene.
