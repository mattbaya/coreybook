**FAMILY OBSERVERS**: THE SUPER THREE and EMILY watching this wonderful chaos. ZEPHYR should be in the corner holding her drawing labeled "GOO???" still looking hopeful. Emily and the twins should be shaking their heads lovingly at Zephyr's suggestion.

The mood should be joyful overwhelm - like discovering the world is full of infinite amazing possibilities.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with a rainbow tornado of colors, all the career symbols swirling in organized chaos around central Corey. The spin lines around his head should be dramatic and the overall feeling should be wonder at life's possibilities.
