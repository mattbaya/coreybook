## PAGE TEXT
"You could test SELF-DRIVING CARS!" Zephyr proclaimed,
"Just ride around in them! You'd never be blamed!
If they run over a garden, a mailbox, a bagel cart—
You'd say, 'Wasn't ME! The car's not very smart!'"

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Zephyr's self-driving car tester fantasy sequence.

The main focus is COREY (still completely bald!) completely RELAXED inside a futuristic self-driving car. He's lounging with his feet up on the dashboard, casually playing an acoustic guitar, with absolutely no concern about driving. He's not touching the steering wheel at all - it spins by itself!

The car's dashboard should feature a robot face that looks increasingly nervous and worried about its driving performance. The car should clearly be autonomous with futuristic sensors and self-driving technology visible.

Behind the car, show a TRAIL OF CHAOS that the AI has created:
- A recently knocked-over mailbox with mail scattered everywhere
- Clear tire tracks running straight through someone's beautiful flower garden
- An overturned bagel cart with the vendor shaking his fist angrily
- Scattered traffic cones (callback to Book 1's construction chaos!)
- Various confused bystanders pointing at the mayhem

Corey should have a speech bubble saying "Wasn't ME!" as he shrugs off any responsibility for the car's poor driving.

THE SUPER THREE (all in blue Super3 t-shirts) stand safely on the sidewalk, watching the chaos and laughing hysterically at this absurd career idea. They should be clearly entertained by the automated mayhem.

Show enthusiastic ZEPHYR (smallest, light brown messy hair) proclaiming this ridiculous career suggestion with pure delight.

The scene should capture the modern absurdity of placing complete trust in technology while avoiding all responsibility for its failures.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with contemporary automotive chaos - bright colors emphasizing the contrast between Corey's relaxation and the destruction happening around him, featuring bold outlines and flat colors.
