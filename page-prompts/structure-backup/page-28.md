## PAGE TEXT
Corey paused for a moment, then said with a grin:
"Or maybe a LIBRARIAN! I could fit in!
An 'Open Scholarship and Research Data Services
Outreach Librarian'—how hard could THAT be?"

But Emily GLARED. "Stay in your LANE!"
So Corey said quickly, "Oh... maybe NOT, then."

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading as a TWO-PART PAGE with a dramatic contrast:

**TOP HALF - THE FANTASY**: COREY (bald!) imagining himself as a peaceful librarian in a beautiful library setting. He wears reading glasses and a cozy cardigan, holding a book titled "VERY COMPLICATED RESEARCH DATA." Towering bookshelves surround him, there's a "SHHH!" sign visible, and his desk nameplate shows the absurdly long title "Open Scholarship and Research Data Services Outreach Librarian." He looks content and intellectual.

**BOTTOM HALF - RECORD SCRATCH REALITY**: The fantasy POPS like a soap bubble! EMILY (short silver/gray pixie hair) is GLARING with arms crossed and one eyebrow raised. Her speech bubble reads "STAY IN YOUR LANE!" Corey (completely bald) looks sheepish with his hands up defensively, saying "Maybe not..." The transition should feel like a sudden reality check.

THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) are visible in the corner, giggling at this family interaction:
- REMI (dark curly hair) trying not to laugh
- OONA (long honey blonde hair) with hand over mouth
- ZEPHYR (light brown messy hair) openly giggling

The key joke is that Emily IS an actual librarian in real life, so Corey suggesting HER profession is particularly presumptuous. The contrast between the peaceful fantasy and Emily's sharp reality check should be dramatic and funny.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the top half in soft, scholarly colors (warm browns, gentle yellows) and the bottom half with bold, dramatic colors emphasizing Emily's authoritative shutdown. The bubble-pop transition should be visually clear and comedic with sharp shadow edges.
