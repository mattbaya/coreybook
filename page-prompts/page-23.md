Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing the warm conclusion to Book 2.

This is a tender transition scene focusing on FAMILY LOVE triumphing over despair. Show the family gathered together in the golden light of evening, with Corey (still completely bald) sitting surrounded by his loving family.

The long career list continues to swirl gently around them, but now show glimpses of even MORE possibilities yet to come:
- "LEGO ENGINEER?" with question mark
- "ACTOR?" in Emily's handwriting  
- "POLITICIAN?" in colorful crayon
- "LAWYER?" with tiny briefcase doodle
- Other careers partially visible, suggesting infinite possibilities

COREY should be genuinely SMILING for the first time since the store closure - this is the emotional turning point. He looks at each family member with deep love and appreciation, his heart visibly lighter.

EMILY (short silver hair) has her hand gently on his shoulder, watching her family intervention succeed with maternal satisfaction.

THE SUPER THREE (all in blue Super3 t-shirts (logo reference: images/super3v3.png)) continue pointing excitedly at different parts of the list:
- **REMI**: Dark brown straight hair, enthusiastically indicating career options
- **Oona**: Long honey hair, bouncing as she explores possibilities
- **Zephyr**: Smallest, gesturing animatedly at her favorite ideas

The setting should transition toward evening:
- Golden warm light bathing the entire scene
- First stars beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky  
- The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) visible in the soft background
- A peaceful, hopeful atmosphere

This scene should convey: family love healing grief, infinite possibilities ahead, and the promise of more dreams to come. There should be a clear "TO BE CONTINUED" feeling as Book 2 ends on hope and anticipation.
