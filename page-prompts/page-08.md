## PAGE TEXT
But the money was tight—oh, so terribly tight!
He'd count up his pennies by dim kitchen light.
The electric bill ZOOMED like a bird to the sky,
And the dollars went OUT faster than they came by.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a dramatic shift in mood from the previous happy scene. It's nighttime in The Store kitchen, and the warm wood-paneled walls are now cast in shadow.

Corey sits alone at a small table under a single copper pendant lamp, surrounded by stacks of bills and receipts. He's counting coins with a worried expression, rubbing his bald head in stress. His navy blue apron looks rumpled and he appears tired and overwhelmed.

The color palette should shift to cooler blues and grays, contrasting sharply with the warm, bustling scene from the previous page.

Key visual elements:
- A piece of paper prominently labeled "ELECTRIC BILL" showing a comically huge number ($3,000!) with a red arrow pointing UP UP UP like a rocket
- Dollar bills with tiny cartoon wings flying out the window into the dark night sky
- The professional espresso machine sitting idle and dark in the background
- Scattered receipts, a calculator, and other financial paperwork

The scene should maintain Seussian whimsy (the flying money is almost cute, the exaggerated bill is absurd rather than devastating) while clearly showing Corey's financial stress. The contrast between this scene and the previous page's success should be evident.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with cooler color palette emphasizing worry and financial pressure, featuring bold outlines and flat colors with sharp shadow edges.
