Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading celebrating the INFINITE POSSIBILITY of the unknown future.

**THE CENTER**: A big, beautiful QUESTION MARK made of golden light, stars, and swirling rainbow colors. This question mark should NOT be ominous - it should be EXCITING! It represents the joy of infinite possibility and should feel like the best punctuation mark ever created.

**ORBITING POSSIBILITIES**: Around the question mark, show hints of all the career Coreys orbiting like planets in a constellation:
- Astronaut Corey floating in space
- Punk rocker Corey with guitar (subtle "Big Dog" reference)
- Sea captain, crypto mogul, LEGO engineer, actor, politician, lawyer, journalist, gamer, chef (still might cook again!), plus ALL the others
- These should be translucent and dreamlike, representing potential futures

**THE FAMILY SILHOUETTE**: At the bottom, show the SILHOUETTE of the family of five - clearly recognizable (Corey's bald head, Emily's short hair, three kids in graduated heights) walking hand-in-hand toward a BRILLIANT HORIZON. Show the five roads converging into one golden path ahead.

**COSMIC ATMOSPHERE**: Fill the scene with stars everywhere, creating a magical, cosmic feeling. The overall mood should be JOYFUL, INFINITE, HOPEFUL.

**THE MESSAGE**: "Nobody knows what's next - and that's perfectly great!" The question mark represents excitement about the unknown, not fear of it.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with cosmic colors - brilliant golds, star-filled blues, rainbow swirls in the question mark. The family should be small but clearly walking confidently toward an unlimited bright future. The overall feeling should be wonder and excitement about unlimited possibilities.
