# Page 49 - The Chef at the Store

## PAGE TEXT
The Store stood behind them, still lovely and old,
With three years of memories, worth more than gold.
And though they were leaving, they'd never forget
The place where their story began—not yet.

**MEMORY ELEMENTS:**
- Subtle ghostly/translucent images floating around the Store:
  - Corey cooking in the kitchen
  - Customers enjoying meals
  - Happy moments from their time there
- These should be soft and dreamlike, not overpowering

**ATMOSPHERE:**
- Bittersweet but hopeful
- Golden hour lighting
- Sense of closure and gratitude
- Looking back with love, not regret

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
