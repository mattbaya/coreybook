Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THE TRANSFORMATION - Corey's dramatic internal and external change.

**THE TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE**: Show Corey's change in a dynamic BEFORE → DURING → AFTER progression:
- **BEFORE**: Shoulders SLUMPED, spine curved, defeated posture
- **DURING**: Shoulders LIFTING, spine beginning to straighten
- **AFTER**: FULLY UPRIGHT AND STRONG, confident and powerful

**THE INTERNAL CHANGE**: Inside Corey, show a Seussian-style lightbulb/heart that SWITCHES ON with a bright beam of light emanating from his chest. This represents the moment his hope and confidence return.

**FACIAL TRANSFORMATION**: His frown should curve into a huge, genuine grin - the biggest, most authentic smile we've seen from him in the entire series.

**GHOSTLY PAST**: Show transparent, sad COREYS from Book 1 (the defeated chef) FADING AWAY as the vibrant, confident new Corey emerges in full, brilliant color.

**FAMILY CELEBRATION**: His family cheers around him:
- **EMILY** (short silver hair) watching with proud joy
- **THE SUPER THREE** (blue Super3 shirts) all celebrating:
  - **REMI** cheering enthusiastically
  - **OONA** clapping and bouncing
  - **ZEPHYR** jumping with pure excitement

The scene should feel like a phoenix rising - the death of old, defeated Corey and the birth of empowered, possibility-filled Corey.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with dramatic lighting effects. Use bright, vibrant colors for the transformed Corey and his family, while the ghostly past versions fade in muted tones. The light beam should be brilliant and hopeful, representing renewed life and confidence.
